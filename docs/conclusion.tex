\subsection{Conclusion and remarks}

This contribution to deliverable D2.2 presents a variational formulation of the elastica in static equilibrium in a narrow straght tube. The open-source code related to this problem is the first step for the dynamic simulation of the elastica in a narrow environment with a more complex shape, i.e. L-shaped or U-shaped tube. This will help in modelling endoscopes undergoing certain load cases during surgeries, for better understanding of the device behaviour due to complex movements during endoscopies.
